# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
A well of knowledge for the U of U Coding Bootcamp. It contains some useful reminders for various aspects of web development and collaborative coding (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and git).
The University of Utah offered a guide to create this webpage as pre-work for the bootcamp. I haven't even started the official course yet and I'm already getting good use out of it.

## Usage
Read each section on the webpage for useful reminders. Open the browser console (CTRL + Shift + i) to get a random section to start with.
